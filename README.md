# general-engineering-mipt

## Description
Solution of Tasks of the course 'General Engineering Training' held in the university from 'February 2022 to April 2022'.

## Content (roughly)

-Programming a Raspberry Pi.

-Comitting the files to your git hub reprository.

-Plotting on Python.

## Existence?
This reprositoty is not deleted for two reasons:

-If it is needed to shine an LED using Raspberry Pi, it might be easier to copy some code from here, than searching and learning from the internet.

-Plotting using python is beyond my intellectual capacity, and so I will try to copy the garbage from here.
